# Capacity Planning

## Objectives
Capacity planning ensures the platform can:
- Absorb workload growth
- Handle failure scenarios
- Support planned maintenance activities

## Capacity Dimensions
- Compute (CPU, memory)
- Storage (IOPS, throughput, latency)
- Network bandwidth

## Failure Domain Considerations
- Node failures
- Zone or rack failures
- Maintenance windows

## Monitoring Inputs
- Resource utilization trends
- Saturation indicators
- Error rates and throttling events

## Actions
- Proactive scaling
- Workload rebalancing
- Capacity expansion planning
