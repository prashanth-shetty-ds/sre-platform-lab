# Network Design

## Design Principles
- Predictable network paths
- Minimal blast radius
- Clear separation between control and data planes

## Network Segments
- Management network
- Kubernetes control plane network
- Worker node / pod network
- External access network

## Security Considerations
- Restricted access to control plane components
- Encrypted communication between components
- Minimal exposure of internal services
