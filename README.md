# SRE Platform Lab

## Overview
This repository represents a production-inspired SRE platform lab designed to demonstrate
how a small internal platform team would design, operate, and evolve a Kubernetes-based
infrastructure with strong reliability, security, and operational discipline.

The focus of this lab is not tool demonstration, but **platform ownership**, **day-2 operations**,
and **failure-aware design**.

## Platform Goals
- Provide a stable and secure Kubernetes platform for application teams
- Enforce baseline security and compliance controls
- Enable safe upgrades, backups, and disaster recovery
- Support observability, incident response, and continuous improvement

## Scope
This platform lab covers:
- Infrastructure and cluster design
- Kubernetes bootstrap and lifecycle management
- Configuration management and automation
- Operational runbooks and upgrade strategies
- Reliability, backup, and disaster recovery considerations

## Non-Goals
- This is not a managed service or SaaS product
- This is not a tutorial-style repository
- This lab prioritizes operational realism over minimal setups

## Intended Audience
- Site Reliability Engineers (SRE)
- Platform Engineers
- Senior DevOps Engineers
- Technical reviewers and recruiters evaluating production readiness

## Repository Structure
See individual folders for architecture, operations, and platform documentation.
